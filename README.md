There are two codes in the repo. 
But one represents basic and primitive code which involves some basic loop without considering some of the contraints.
Second updated code enhanced the code from first one. In which I have used try-except block to check for the constraints and make sure that customer should enter the correct integer value while entering the qunatity.
